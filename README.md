# **Space Duck**
_by Afra Almazrouei, Meera Almheiri, Máté Hekfusz, and Olivia Whiteside_

## Project Description
Introducing the story of **Space Duck**: a delusional hero trying to find his way home. The beginning of the story is the duck in space, wondering how long he’s been floating around. Our goal was to create an interactive comic that takes you through the unlikely journey of a duck finding his way back home through the vastness of space. We strived for a highly interactive, playful experience that was inclusive to all ages and people and told a fun but heartwarming story.

The concept of the comic website, from the angle of artistic choices, is a dark background with everything else being colorful.

## Process
We approached implementation through three considerations: visual design, structure, and interaction. After defining our comic idea as a group, Olivia and Afra created the visual architecture including screen mock-ups, PNGs, SVGs, and gif animations, using **Procreate** and **Illustrator.** During the same time Máté and Meera created the base code structure that we would build upon, building the HTML and CSS for each panel, and programming numerous listeners and transition events using **jQuery.**

As we moved toward completing the final project we would meet as a team to solve problems across slides, edit and integrate code, and merge the visual storytelling with our structural parameters.

Our primary concept was to tell the homecoming story of our duck who we think is through space until we reveal he was actually in the water. To represent the delusion, we used 3 different visual duck styles as a representation of the proximity to reality, from the cartoonish starter duck to the "realistic" end duck.

**Coding contributions:**

- **Olivia:** Panels 1 and 6
    
- **Máté:** Panels 2 and 3 (also integrated and adjusted code from all other slides)
    
- **Meera:** Panel 4
    
- **Afra:** Panel 5

## Reflection

We began our project by initializing our storyline. Once we settled on a concept, our ideas kept rushing in. All of our set expectations, with consistent communication and teamwork, were achieved. Our progress was substantial, the initial rough draft was entirely outshined by our final project.

Our initial idea was to fit everything in one page using a chaining function and have the duck character transition from one panel to the other. However, we thought that it would spoil the vision we had for the website to be immersive and interactive for the user. With a lot of research and hard work from all teammates, and Máté’s impressive computer science skills, we were all able to learn and implement new coding concepts and achieve our concept.

Our vision remained consistent throughout the whole project, we knew exactly what we wanted to create, all we had to do was make it happen. The work was divided according to interest and background knowledge. However, all members contributed in all processes, whether it was technical or creative. We were all motivated and eager to make this project come to life and with lots of effort we are able to finally present...***Space Duck!***
